This tool allows you to encrypt the contents of a git commit, such that the
encrypted branch can be pushed, pulled elsewhere, and then decrypted.
Encryption uses a fixed salt, so it is potentially vulnerable to a skilled
attacker; this is necessary to allow git to handle the encrypted content
efficiently.  Use at your own risk.

Designed for moving personal data around in a moderately safe format.
Stores encryption keys in GNOME keyring.  Use 'genpass > keyfile' to initialize
a key; use 'setpass < keyfile' on any other host to import the key
into the keyring.  Delete the keyfile on all hosts when done setting up.

Use 'cryptbranch encrypt -o <cleartext commit> -x <encrypted branch>' to
encrypt the commit given in '-o' and append the resulting encrypted commit
to the encrypted branch given in '-x'.

Use 'cryptbranch decrypt -o <cleartext branch> -x <encrypted commit>' to
decrypt the encrypted commit at '-x' and (if the parent commit is available
in the repository) make the decrypted commit the head of the branch
specified in '-o'.
